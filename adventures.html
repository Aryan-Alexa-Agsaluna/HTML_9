                        <h3>My Island Experience
                        </h3><br>
                        <p>One of my adventures in the island of  Boracay were  alaways amazing.
                          Known by many as a popular tourist destination because of its natural powdery white sand
                         Beach,  It is a popular destination for tourists from all over the world, and it has been featured in numerous magazines and travel shows. I was captivated by the island's beauty.                         
                        </p>                 
                    </div>
                </div>      
                <div class="box">               
                    <div class="content"> <br>
                        <img src="../../Downloads/HTML_9/images/t5.jpg" alt="My Adventure">
                        </h3><br>
                        <p> One of my favorite things to do in Boracay was to simply relax on the beach and take in the stunning views. The water was crystal clear and the sand was so soft that it felt like I was walking on a cloud. I also loved going for walks along the beach, especially at sunset. The colors of the sky and water were simply breathtaking.
