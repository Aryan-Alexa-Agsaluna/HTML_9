                        <p>The natural world around us is essential for our survival and well-being. However,
                             Climate change and biodiversity degradation due to pollution are the challenges our 
                             environment faces today. WE all have a role to play in protecting the environment. 
                             We can create a healthier, more sustainable future for everyone.

                        <h3>Why Environmental Science?</h3><br>
                        <p>Environmental Science is a field of study that focuses 
                        on the preservation of our finite natural resources while 
                        introducing environmental technologies that can mitigate 
                        the impact on the environment. 
                        It helps us to understand different environmental challenges
                        and issues and develop solutions on how to protect Mother Earth.
